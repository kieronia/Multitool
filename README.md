Usage - make sure you have path and pip setup and run InstallModules.bat the first time you download this, from there run start.bat or Multitool.py, enjoy this rebuild!

You can also rest assure that this is safe and you can also learn from how it works - because you have the source and everything.

Please also note I'm used to doing console applications, this was my first ever gui.

Tkinter kept crashing when I tried animating the background so I made it a solid colour

Also note that I didn't wanna touch the tool in any way, I copied the features that I could see in videos but obviously it's not gonna be the same
