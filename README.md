I've got some respect for the kid himself but his fans get toxic whenever someone else claims to have any knowledge, upon someone talking about cracking his multitool and my response being "it's probably easier just to rebuild something like it", a fan called me a skid for absouletely no reason. Boredom and the fan "epikly exposing me" were part of the reason I made this.
You can also rest assure that this is safe and you can also learn from how it works - because you have the source and everything.

Please also note I'm used to doing console applications, this was my first ever gui.

Tkinter kept crashing when I tried animating the background so I made it a solid colour

Also note that I didn't wanna touch the tool in any way, I copied the features that I could see in videos but obviously it's not gonna be the same
